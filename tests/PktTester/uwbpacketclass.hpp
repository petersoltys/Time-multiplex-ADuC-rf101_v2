 * @version 1.0
 * @brief Class is equipped with all stuff needed for generating and reading packets from uwb sensor network.
 *
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Data in UWB sensor network are being sent into central unit via wireless connection. Central unit has
 * device (modul) for recieving such communication and sending recieved bytes through serial link into
 * computer. The software must be able read and write into such packets as well as send them via RS232.
 *
 * This class provides functionality for both, recieving and sending packets. You can comment one of that
 * functionality to reduce size of compiled program if you do not need it.
